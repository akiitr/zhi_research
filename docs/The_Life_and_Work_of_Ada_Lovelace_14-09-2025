Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace (10 December 1815 â€“ 27 November 1852) was an English mathematician and writer, chiefly known for her work on Charles Babbage's proposed mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. She is often regarded as the first computer programmer, her notes on the Analytical Engine including what is recognized as an algorithm intended to be carried out by a machine. This discovery, the potential of computers, and the future of the field, led her to be a figure of admiration in the modern computer culture and a subject in popular culture.
